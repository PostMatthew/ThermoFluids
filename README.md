# ThermoFluids
This is a repo for all code written for ME 475: Thermo-Fluids Laboratory, the majority of code was written by myself, but all uncertainity analysis was written by [Christian Hollar](https://github.com/christianhollar), and a handful of additional functions were written by James Kiley.

Included in this repo is all relevant data, scripts, and functions used for analysis. All analysis was conducted in MATLAB and can be run in MATLAB 2019 or newer. 

This Repo consists of three folders pretaining to the three experiments that were performed throughout the semester.
1. Wind Tunnel: Determining the coefficient of drag for spheres of varying diamaters and texture
2. Spark Ignition Engine: Characterizing the performance of a lawn mower engine at various throttle positions
3. Steam Turbine: Characterizing the perfomance of a team turbine power plant and how well the turbine follows the "Real" Rankine Cycle.
